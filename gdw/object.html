So like, hr makes a long line, like a visible divider. While the br one makes a small break, almost like a bootleg paragraph. I'll show below! owo And if you read it all, I'll give the art thing, because I'm good at google stuff!

<h1>
The Lullaby
</h1>


<p>By Sorae Igarashi</p>

<div>Naughty Birdie's song is made</div>
by pecking holes in trees

<div>Willows, cedars, sycamores</div>
and proud oaks reduced to cheese


<div>Woodland gods, all in a huff</div>
have forever cursed your naughty beak


<div>What it pecks, it poisons now;</div>
your food, your nest even your young


<div>Your friends now all fear you</div>
<div>But your tears ring clearly through the wood</div>
even as they taint the dew


<div>Such a sad, sad, little birdy</div>
<div>Maybe one day this song will lift the curse</div>
and set you free.
