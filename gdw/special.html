Special Characters

Since the greater than and less than symbols, plus the and symbol,  have special meaning in HTML, you can’t use these characters to represent themselves. Instead, you need to use the so called “special characters” to represent them. For example, to have a less than sign to appear in your document, you need to use &lt; to represent it
